I cannot create, generate, edit, or produce images, including PNG icons. I can only work with text-based code files.

However, I can provide you with detailed specifications and guidance for creating this icon that a designer or AI image generator could use:

Would you like me to help you with any code-related aspects of implementing this icon in your PWA manifest or helping with the technical integration once you have the icon file?
